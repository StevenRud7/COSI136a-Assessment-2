# COSI136a-Assessment-2

Using an ASR corpus to train and evaluate an ASR system. Created by Steven Rud and Daniel Mints. 

The Wav2Vec2+CTC Model.py code creates the Wav2Vec2+CTC Model. This has already been created and uploaded by us. 

The Main Project 2 ASR System Code.py code Evaluates the ASR System on either medium or small sized Whisper Models and on either a test.tsv or dev.tsv dataset.

The .csv files contain all the results for our ASR System on the different models and datasets.
